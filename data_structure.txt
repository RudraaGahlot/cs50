1. ARRAY
    - A array is a sequence of contigous in  memory all of which are similar data types.
        Array's and other data structures are 0-indexed means it start counting with 0 to n-1 (size of the data structure - 1)

    syntax of initialing an array
    - data_type array_name [size_of_array].
    for example ->  int score[4];
                ->  int subject[6]; 

    for initialising each value of the array or we say indexes we can simple do that by:
        array_name[index] = value;
        for example -> score[0] = 72;
                    -> subject[0] = 1;

1. ARRAY
    - A array is a sequence of contigous in  memory all of which are similar data types.
        Array's and other data structures are 0-indexed means it start counting with 0 to n-1 (size of the data structure - 1)

    syntax of initialing an array
    - data_type array_name [size_of_array].
    for example ->  int score[4];
                ->  int subject[6]; 

    for initialising each value of the array or we say indexes we can simple do that by:
        array_name[index] = value;
        for example -> score[0] = 72;
                    -> subject[0] = 1;

2.  STRING 
    - Similarly as array, string are also a sequence of contigous in memory but string only contain char data type.
        these are also 0-indexed but unlike other data structure string uses one extra space in the memory.
        explaination: because string can be any length and we do not define any particular size of a string, computer underneerh the hood alocate one extra space to the string to knows where the string ends and it store a spceial char '\0' which known as nul.
        that's why we use double quotes to represent string and single quote to represent the char that really the diff. b/w char and string.
